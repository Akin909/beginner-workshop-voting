# React Vote workshop

This Workshop will hopefully teach you the fundamentals of using React.

The goal today is to fill the gaps of this boilerplate. It's a simple voting app with a remote API.

The only thing we ask of you is to have fun and try to stick to functional programming as much as you can.

##Â Setup

The repository is set up to use `create-react-app`, which comes with React, Webpack, ESLint and Babel.

Things we've added for this example are:

- Redux
- Redux Thunk (for side-effects)
- Styled Components (for styling)
- Victory (for the chart diagram)

Bonus points if you'd like to use:

- Redux Observable

## Proceeding with your solution

We've sprinkled in a lot of `// TODO` comments into the code, that should guide you
on what to do. It is generally beneficial to start with the `index.js` file and
work your way down the dependency tree.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask!

If you would like to use an alternative to Redux Thunk, Victory, Styled Components, etc. feel
free to rip out our templates.

## The API

Access [http://api.alexrieux.fr](http://api.alexrieux.fr) for the documentation,
although the comments should provide you enough hints.
